# Village-Web

## Introduction

It takes a village. Something we hear often, but how would that look? Users complete a profile, consisting of a screening tool that checks for background criminal records (for safety). A form for the user to input any skills/services they are willing to provide. Another form for the user to input any services they are looking for. The basic concept is for members in the community to come together to help with theins and outs of everyday life. The user will post their available services for other users to select from and offer a service in return. Children are able to search a list of needed services that they can accept in exchange for their community service hours credit requirements. This will allow people to obtain things they need while also saving money. If itâ€™s for a skilled project, they only provide the cost of supplies when needed. Know how to paint walls? How would you like to exchange painting a room for a private dance lesson from your neighbor to surprise your wife for date night? Need your gutters cleaned? Perhaps you can do that while the owner makes some handmade wreaths and such for holiday decorations. You can even provide and receive recurring services like, cleaning services exchanged for lawn upkeep, once a week. Or browse a feed that shows services available in your area. The biggest challenge would be implementing a feature rich app, that is also simplistic for users who are not tech friendly.
